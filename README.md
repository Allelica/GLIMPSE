# GLIMPSE TOOLS 

GLIMPSE is a set of tools for phasing and imputation for low-coverage sequencing datasets:
- GLIMPSE_chunk splits the genome into chunks ready for imputation/phasing
- GLIMPSE_impute quickly imputes low coverage sequencing data from a reference panel 
- GLIMPSE_phase phases & imputes low coverage sequencing data
- GLIMPSE_ligate concatenates phased chunks of data into chromosome wide files
- GLIMPSE_sample allows sampling plausible haplotype configurations from the files
- GLIMPSE_concordance computes multiple accuracy metrics given some validation genotype data
 
The source code is provided in an open source format (license MIT) on github.
