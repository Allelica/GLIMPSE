# LCC TOOLS 

LCC is a set of tools for phasing and imputation for low-coverage sequencing datasets:
- LCC_chunk splits the genome into chunks ready for imputation/phasing
- LCC_impute quickly imputes low coverage sequencing data from a reference panel 
- LCC_phase phases & imputes low coverage sequencing data
- LCC_ligate concatenates phased chunks of data into chromosome wide files
- LCC_sample allows sampling plausible haplotype configurations from the files
